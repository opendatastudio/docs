By default, algorithms in opendata.studio run in the python-run-base Docker container, which provides commonly used libraries such as `numpy` and `pandas`. If you need a library not included in this default container, you can easily create a custom Docker container to run your algorithm.

## Creating a custom Docker container

Let's say you need to use the scikit-learn library, which isn't included in python-run-base. To do this, you can create a custom container within the `helloworld` algorithm configuration directory:

```bash
mkdir helloworld/container
touch helloworld/Dockerfile
```

Inside the Dockerfile, write the following container definition:

```docker title="helloworld/Dockerfile"
FROM opends/python-run-base:v1

RUN pip install scikit-learn
```

This container definition uses `python-run-base` as the base image and installs `scikit-learn` on top.

## Building your container

Now you can build the custom Docker container by running:

```bash
docker build -t mycontainer.
```

This command creates your new container with the tag `mycontainer`.

## Updating the algorithm configuration

To use this custom container, you'll need to specify it in your algorithm's configuration file:

Edit the algorithm.json file to point to your new container:

```json title="helloworld/algorithm.json" ins="mycontainer"
{
  "name": "helloworld",
  ...
  "container": "mycontainer",
  "signature": {
    "inputs": [
      ...
    ],
    "outputs": [
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

This tells opendata.studio to use `mycontainer` when executing the `helloworld` algorithm.

## Importing our new dependency

Next, confirm that the custom container is working by importing `scikit-learn` in your algorithm. Open `helloworld/algorithm.py` and add the import statement:

```python title="helloworld/algorithm.py" ins={1-2}
import sklearn

def main(data, function):
    """Take the average along the long axis with the specified function"""
    return {
        "result": getattr(data, function)(axis=1).to_frame(name="result"),
    }
```

## Running the algorithm

Finally, run your algorithm using the following commands:

```bash
opends reset  # Reset to ensure we clear any old run configurations
opends init
opends load data data/tabulardata.csv  # Our algorithm will fail if we forget to load some input data
opends run
```

If everything is set up correctly, your algorithm should execute in your custom container without any errors. Congrats - you've successfully executed your algorithm in a custom environment.
