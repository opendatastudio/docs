By default, algorithms in a datakit run in the python-run-base Docker container,
which provides commonly used libraries such as `numpy` and `pandas`. If you need
a library not included in this default container, you can easily create a custom
Docker container to run your algorithm.

## Creating a custom Docker container

Let's say you need to use the scikit-learn library, which isn't included in
python-run-base. To do this, you can create a custom container within the
`helloworld` algorithm configuration directory:

```bash
mkdir helloworld/container
touch helloworld/container/Dockerfile
```

Inside the Dockerfile, write the following container definition:

```docker title="helloworld/container/Dockerfile"
FROM opendatastudio/python-run-base:latest

RUN pip install scikit-learn
```

This container definition uses `python-run-base` as the base image and installs
`scikit-learn` on top.

## Building your container

Now you can build the custom Docker container by running:

```bash
docker build -t mycontainer.
```

This command creates your new container with the tag `mycontainer`.

## Updating the algorithm configuration

To use this custom container, you'll need to specify it in your algorithm's
configuration file:

Edit the algorithm.json file to point to your new container:

```json title="helloworld/algorithm.json" ins="mycontainer"
{
  "name": "helloworld",
  ...
  "container": "mycontainer",
  "signature": {
    "inputs": [
      ...
    ],
    "outputs": [
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

This tells the datakit to use `mycontainer` when executing the `helloworld`
algorithm.

## Importing our new dependency

Next, confirm that the custom container is working by importing `scikit-learn`
in your algorithm. Open `helloworld/algorithm.py` and add the import statement:

```python title="helloworld/algorithm.py" ins={1-2} ins={5}
import sklearn

def main(data, function):
    """Take the average along the long axis with the specified function"""
    print(sklearn.__version__)
    return {
        "result": getattr(data, function)(axis=1).to_frame(name="result"),
    }
```

## Running the algorithm

Finally, run your algorithm using the following commands:

```bash
dk reset  # Reset to ensure we clear any old run configurations
dk init
dk load data data/tabulardata.csv  # Our algorithm will fail if we forget to load some input data
dk run
```

If everything is set up correctly, your algorithm should print the version of
`scikit-learn` that you just installed in your custom container. Congrats -
you've successfully executed your algorithm in a custom environment.
